# BetterDiscord Extended Typing Sounds
 
This plugin plays keyboard "click" sounds when a key is pressed. Multiple different sounds can be choosen from in the settings and the volume can be adjusted. 

I mainly made this because the original type sound addon does not work anymore (or at least it did not when i started my addon as a result of that). This plugin has far better structured code and does things slightly differently.



### Note

The sounds are taken from mechvibes.com (they dont list a license there, just that they are "fully open source - whatever that means.) I am not using any of their code, since i reversed the playback from their "sound-packs" sub-page.
